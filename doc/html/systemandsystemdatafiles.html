<h2 id="system data">4. The system and system data files</h2>
In this section we will discuss the fundamental data supports of the system and how the system configure works.
We have reviewed the <a href="./configurethesimulation.html#systemcfg"> system configure</a> file of the quick start,
look up it again,<br/>
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">&lt;system&gt;
   &lt;path&gt;
   &lt;world&gt;
   &lt;<a href="#detectorinsystem">detector</a>&gt;

&lt;/system&gt;</font>
</pre></div>
We will discuss more details in these tags <code>&lt;<a href="#systemdatadetector">detector</a>&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;<a href="#systemdatasource">source</a>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;<a href="#systemdatacollimation">collimation</a>&gt;</code> 
and <code>&lt;<a href="#systemconsole">console</a>&gt;</code> to help user to set up their own CT systems.
Such a simulated system can be used on CT designments, calibration (of a real CT), correction and reconstruction algorithm, 
defects analysis, production and service supports, in a word everything a physics/algorithm group can do.<br/>

<h3 id="howtousecorr">4.1 How to use the .corr files</h3>
As a basic knowledge, I will present how we governing the binary datafiles. 
In our frame the calibration tables are those binary datafiles with .corr extended-name, each of them has its data format configurable by a configure file.
For example, the detector position calibration table <code><a href="..\..\system\mod\detectorframe\">$systemdata\detectorframe\</a>detector_sample_unit24.corr</code>
we used in &lt;detector&gt; is such a .corr file in recording the detector pixels' position and other geometry data. 
This file can be used in simulation, calibration, reconstruction or any other situation need it.<br/>
<br/>
Let me show you how to open it, <br/>

<div class="box-info"><pre>
(don't forget to addpath, e.g. in D:\CTsimulation\ run <code>addpath(genpath('.'));</code>)

>> detcorr = loaddata('.\system\mod\detectorframe\detector_sample_unit24.corr')

detcorr = 

  包含以下字段的 struct:

               ID: [4×1 uint8]
              SID: 550
              SDD: 1000
           Npixel: 950
           Nslice: 24
    focalposition: [3×1 single]
            mid_U: 475.7300
           hx_ISO: 0.5494
           hz_ISO: 0.5494
          reserve: []
         position: [68400×1 single]
>> | 
</pre></div>
By using the function <code>loaddata</code> the .corr file was read to a structure. 
The format of this .corr is defined by the configure file <a href="..\..\IO\standard\detector_corr_v1.0.xml">~\IO\standard\detector_corr_v1.0.xml</a>.
Click to open it, each of the tags in the configure file is corresponding to a field in the structure, e.g. the 'ID' reads
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">  &lt;ID&gt;
    &lt;offset&gt;0&lt;/offset&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;Uint8&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;4&lt;/number&gt;
    &lt;size&gt;1&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;/ID&gt;</font>
</pre></div>
which means the 'ID' is an array with 4 uint8 data, defined by our grammar of the data format,<br/>
in which the <code>&lt;offset&gt;</code> is the offset of this field of data to the file head, 0 means it is the first one;
Set to <code>nan</code> or <code>[]</code> it will be filled by a default value to occupy after its previous field, 
you may do that when you are not ensure how much it is or it is viarable;<br/>
in which the <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> is the class of this tag, it is 'uint8'; (capital letter is to avoid a bug in reading .xml) 
The class can be 'single', 'double', 'char', 'uint16', 'int16' and so on, they are listed in <a href="..\..\tools\uint8cast.m">uint8cast.m</a>
and one more the 'struct' is also a class;<br/>
in which the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> is the length of the array, here it is a 4×1 array, only 1D array is permitted;<br/>
in which the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> is the bytes number of each element in the array, 
for class 'uint8' it is 1 and e.g. for class 'double' it is 8.<br/>
<br/>
A field shall contain those four parameters to help the program read them: move to the <code>&lt;offset&gt;</code> position, 
read <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>*<code>&lt;size&gt;</code> of bytes and cast them to a <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> array in length <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>.
An advanced function is the tags support cross-reference and evaluation, move to the tag <code>&lt;position&gt;</code>,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">  &lt;position&gt;
    &lt;offset&gt;72&lt;/offset&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;Single&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;number&gt;$.Npixel*$.Nslice*3&lt;/number&gt;
    &lt;size&gt;4&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;/position&gt;</font>
</pre></div>
in the tag <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> the special symbol <code>$</code> is the symbol of reference, 
<code>$.Npixel</code> means to call the variable S.Npixel where S is the structure in reading/writing. 
And the string will be evaluated as a formula (could with functions). 
Using this property we can setup flexible formats of data, both the <code>&lt;offset&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;size&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> can be variable base on cross-references and evaluations.<br/>
<br/>

By the way the function <code>loaddata.m</code> can also load a .mat file as the matlab build in funtion <code>load.m</code>. 
Therefore all those .corr files can be replaced by the .mat files without causing confusion.<br/>

In function <code>loaddata.m</code> a sub fucntion <code>loadbindata</code> was called to read the binary files, it can be used alone like this,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> detcorr = loadbindata('.\system\mod\detectorframe\detector_sample_unit24.corr', '.\IO\standard\detector_corr_v1.0.xml');
</pre></div>
to return exactly same result as the function <code>loaddata</code>, please check that. 
The input <code>'.\IO\standard\detector_corr_v1.0.xml'</code> is what we messioned the format configure file. 
The function <code>loaddata</code> can find that format configure file in the folder <a href="..\..\IO\standard\">~\IO\standard\</a> 
by the tags in the filename of the .corr file. We will present how it do that later, let's move on that example to show how to create a .corr file.<br/>
I'd like to change some vaules in the structure,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> detcorr.ID = [0 0 1 11];
>> detcorr.focalposition = repmat(detcorr.focalposition', 16, 1);
>> detcorr.mid_U = repmat(detcorr.mid_U, 16, 1);
</pre></div>
OK, now I will pack the new <code>detcorr</code> to another .corr file,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> mkdir test
>> anotherfile = './test/detector_another_v1.11.corr';
>> cfgfile = cfgmatchrule(anotherfile);
>> packstruct(detcorr, readcfgfile(cfgfile), anotherfile);
</pre></div>
Now you can find a file 'detector_another_v1.11.corr' is created in folder './test'. You may read it by the function <code>loaddata</code> also,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> newcorr = loaddata('./test/detector_another_v1.11.corr');
</pre></div>
The <code>packstruct</code> is the fundamental function to pack a structure to a binary file, its first input argument is the structure to pack, 
the second input argument is the format configure which can be read by <code>readcfgfile</code> from a .xml file, 
the third input argument is the filepath/filename.<br/>
The function <code>cfgmatchrule</code> is the key role in finding the coupled format configure file, 
it was looking for that configure file in the folder .\IO\standard\ following a simple rule: when the file name is '&lt;name&gt;_..._v&ltn.m&gt;.corr',
the format configure file is '&lt;name&gt;_corr_v&lt;n.m&gt;.xml'. 
As you found, what is called by function <code>loaddata</code> in looking for the format configure files.
If the string tag '_v&ltn.m&gt;' is skipped in the file name the default v1.0 will be employed. 
<br/>
Note that, a format configure file are (and shall) used <b>both for reading and writing</b> a binary file, 
one format one configure file.<br/>
<br/>
In our frame the rawdata (.raw), the calibration tables (.corr) and other binary files (.bin) are all govened by such a mechanism 
with a set of format configure files in folder <a href="..\..\IO\standard\">~\IO\standard\</a>. 
In the default folder <a href="..\..\IO\standard\">~\IO\standard\</a> you can find many samples of the grammar to define a formated binary file,
e.g. the rawdata <a href="..\..\IO\standard\rawdata_v1.0.xml">rawdata_v1.0.xml</a> which is the format of the .raw files 
we used in previous simulation and reconstruction samples,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">&lt;raw&gt;
  &lt;offset&gt;0&lt;/offset&gt;
  &lt;class&gt;Struct&lt;/class&gt;
  &lt;number&gt;[]&lt;/number&gt;
  &lt;size&gt;[]&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;ID&gt;
  ...
</font>
</pre></div>
The root tag in the rawdata_v1.0.xml is the <code>&lt;raw&gt;</code>, like the detector_corr_v1.0.xml whose root tag is <code>&lt;detector&gt;</code>.
The root tag defined a 'big' field structure mapping to the whole file to read/write. 
Here the <code>raw</code> is such a structure mapping to the rawdata, 
in which the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> is the size of a rawdata package (with datahead) of each view, 
whose value will be calculated by the sub-tags defined after that (which is variable);
in which <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> is the viewnumber, which will be determined by the file size or some console coeffients.<br/>
In this way we expanded the data format grammar to sequence of data with nested format structure to use on sequence data interface, 
e.g. the rawdata and other time sequence data of CT. You may open the .raw file we generated in the Quick Start,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> raw = loaddata('..\Data\rawdata_series1_120KV200mA_v1.0.raw');
</pre></div>
It will return a structure array in length 1440.<br/>
<br/>

All of the binary data files' format are configurable and even the configure file folder <a href="..\..\IO\standard\">~\IO\standard\</a> is configurable.
Did you use to know the tag <code>&lt;IOstandard&gt;</code> in <a href="./configurethesimulation.html#systempath">simulation</a> and
<a href="./configurethereconpipeline.html#reconcfg">recon</a>? that it is. 
As a CTer you should maintain your own <code>&lt;IOstandard&gt;</code> folder to manage them in replacing the default ~\IO\standard\ 
and use it in anywhere need the file formats.<br/>
The <code>&lt;loaddata&gt;</code> should be used like this,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> data = loaddata('your data file', 'your IOstandard folder');
</pre></div>
and the  <code>&lt;cfgmatchrule&gt;</code> also should be used like,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> cfgfile = cfgmatchrule('your data file', 'your IOstandard folder');
</pre></div>
This is the right way in using them, do not skip 'your IOstandard folder'.<br/>
<br/>
Some one may ask if a data contains hundreds of fields it will be disaster in coding the format file.
Don't worry, that is system engineer's job.<br/>
I'm kidding :-D, we offered a tool for a lazzy system engineer,
showing up this sample:<br/>
Creating a sample structure,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> a.tag1 = 1.0;
>> a.tag2.subtag1 = uint8([1 2 3]);
</pre></div>
This function will generate a format configure structure of an input structure,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> a_cfg.a = structbincfg(a);
</pre></div>
Saving it to .xml,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> struct2xml(a_cfg, '.\test\a.xml');
</pre></div>
Now we have a format configure file <a href="..\..\test\a.xml">'.\test\a.xml'</a>. 
Therefore, in coding a format file you can produce a structure what you want in workspace then use that tool to have a draft, have a good use.<br/>
<br/>


<h3 id="detectorinsystem">4.2 The &lt;detector&gt;</h3>
In simulation the detector contains these sub tags,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">   &lt;detector&gt;
      &lt;frame_base/&gt;
      &lt;frame_extra/&gt;
      &lt;spectresponse/&gt;
      &lt;ASG/&gt;
      &lt;filter/&gt;
   &lt;/detector&gt;</font>
</pre></div>

and in reconstruction the detector data is in the <code>&lt;system&gt;</code>,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
<font color="blue">&lt;system&gt;
   &lt;detector_corr/&gt;
&lt;/system&gt;</font>
</pre></div>

In which the <code>&lt;frame_base&gt;</code> in simulation and the <code>&lt;frame_base&gt;</code> in reconstruction is the detector calibration table. 
We employed that in the Quick Start is the file ~\system\mod\detectorframe\detector_sample_unit24.corr
which reads,
<div class="box-info"><pre>
>> detcorr = loaddata('.\system\mod\detectorframe\detector_sample_unit24.corr')

detcorr = 

  包含以下字段的 struct:

               ID: [4×1 uint8]
              SID: 550
              SDD: 1000
           Npixel: 950
           Nslice: 24
    focalposition: [3×1 single]
            mid_U: 475.7300
           hx_ISO: 0.5494
           hz_ISO: 0.5494
          reserve: []
         position: [68400×1 single]
>> | 
</pre></div>
In which the <code>ID</code> is an ID array, e.g. <code>[0 0 0 0]</code>. We recommend to set the last 2 byte of the ID to the version of the format, 
e.g. <code>[0 0 1 0]</code> for version v1.0, <code>[0 0 1 11]</code> for version v1.11. It will not affect the reading/writing of the .corr file,
just for backup.<br/>
In which the <code>SID</code> is the distance from ISO centor to the ideal focalspot. 
It is a nominal value somtimes use to estimation and in simulation and reconstruction what realy work is the XYZ position 
of the focalspots but not the SID.<br/>
In which the <code>SID</code> is the distance from focalspot to the detectors.
It is also a nominal value, in simulation and reconstruction what realy work is the XYZ position of the detectors and the focal spots.<br/>
In which the <code>Npixel</code> is the pixel number of each slice of the detector frame.<br/>
In which the <code>Nslice</code> is the slice number of the detector frame.<br/>
In which the <code>focalposition</code> is the XYZ postion of the ideal focal spot (so called U-focal), it will be used in detector position calibration.
The U-focal is not always an available focal spot in protocols, but essentially in mechaninal designments. 
Normally it shall on the middle slice ans the detector modulars shall vertically (at least on XY-plane) face to it, 
and the ASG (anti-sactter-grids) shall point to this position.
<br/>
In which the <code>mid_U</code> is the ideal mid-channel corresponding to the ideal focal position (so called U-mid-channel), 
it will be used in the focal position calibration.
Normally, it should be .5, .25 or .75, here the .73 is somehow not a property value, but permitted.<br/>
In calibration we assume the positions of both the detector and U-focal position is in error to their ideal position. 
An initial ideal detector calibration table will be loaded to do the focal position calibration, detector position calibration and mid-channel(s) calibration,
we will discuss the details later.<br/>

In which the <code>hx_ISO</code> is the sampling rate on x-direction of back projection, this value will be used in rebin.<br/>
In which the <code>hz_ISO</code> is the sampling rate on z-direction of back projection, this value will be used in rebin and/or backprojection.
It is almost the nominal slice thickness.<br/>
In which the <code>reserve</code> is a null space in the .corr file.<br/>
In which the <code>position</code> is the XYZ position of the detectors, which is a Npixel*Nslice*3 matrix (shall be reshaped to) recording Npixel*Nslice X components, 
Npixel*Nslice Y components and Npixel*Nslice Z components. The order of the pixels is in clockwise and the order of the slices is along the Z-direction.
We saved every detector pixels' XYZ position (not their fan angles), believe me it is truely necessary, 
which will be calibrated by a measurement of each pixels' position error.<br/>
<br/>
I may add, the XYZ positions are relative, we recommend to define them at the zero-state by the DICOM coordinates.
The 'zero-state' is the state that the X-ray tube is on 12 o'clock (above) and detector frame is on 6 o'clock (bottom). 
The DICOM coordinate is such that ISO center is the original point, facing to the CT X is to right, Y is to bottom and Z is to front.<br/>
<br/>
To set up your own CT system you need a detector calibration table to record the designed geometry of the detector frame, 
your mechanism group should give that. It will be used in simulation, calibration and reconstruction, 
we recommend to reuse the table in all those tasks. 
And in simulation more geometry data could be necessary than what used in calibration and reconstruction, 
e.g. the size of the detector pixels, to support advanced simulation requirements.
Therefore we employed the tag <code>&lt;frame_extra&gt;</code> in the simulation configure pointing to an extra data file of detector geometry.<br/>
We didn't prepare a binary data format of this file, please use .mat file for it.
